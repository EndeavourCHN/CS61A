# CS61A (Fall 2024)

This repo contains all my solutions to the labs, homeworks and projects in CS61A (Fall 2024 version).

Normally, I would try to solve all the problems including the ECs (Extra Challenge). But if I skipped certain ones, I'd mark them out below.

Besides the assignments, I also included some interesting experiments covered in the lectures, which are stored in the [lectures/](lectures/) folder. Since the lecture version isn't exactly Fall 2024, the lecture numbers in the folder names are just for reference.

## Notes

- Project [hog](projects/hog/) is uploaded with Problem 12 (Final Strategy) skipped.
